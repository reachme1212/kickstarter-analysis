# kickstarter-analysis with Excel

**Overview of project :**

We are analyzing the given data set to help Louise start a successful fundraising campaign for the play “Fever” she has a goal of $10000 USD.

**Purpose:**

Purpose of this analysis is to find insights from the dataset based on goals and launch date to help Louise achieve the goal of raising $10000 USD and to find metrics that will help achieve the goal.

**Analysis  and challenges:**

Major challenges I faced is to fix excel glitches for pivots and Vlookups and to figure out what are the right questions to ask to help with this analysis. unable to add a folder in GitHub to store images


**Outcomes based on launch date:**

1.Fund raising campaigns for parent category “theaters” did well when it’s launched during the month of May from the year 2009 to 2017. Out of total theater based fundraising campaigns in the data given 1369, there were 839 successful campaigns, 61% of campaigns became successful in the category theaters and it’s important to note that out of these 839, 166 successful events happened in the month of May (2009 to 2017), that shows 13.2% of all successful events came from the month of May. June and July were relatively successful with percentage of 11.9% and 10.4%

2.The campaigns that started in the month of dec has the lowest success rate of 8.9% (75/839), out of all successful campaigns launched during 2009 to 2017 it’s safe to say that to successfully reach the goal of raising $10000, we need to launch the campaign in may not in dec.

**Outcomes based on Goals:**

1.There is correlation between higher fund-raising goals and lower success rate, Goals above $45000 to 49999 has a success rate of 0% and goals greater than 50000 has the success rate of 19.37%, we have a goal of 10000 USD, in the range of $10000 to 14999, the success rate is 47.73%.

2.Top 3 success rates are for goals between 1000 to 10000 USD, 68.44%,66.61%, & 53.21%, Its safe conclusion to say we have a better chance of being a successful campaign if we lower our fund-raising goal of $10000, to fit into the range of 5000 to 9999 USD.

**Limitations of this dataset:**

1.We know the success rate for theaters are high in the month of May, June and July during 2009 to 2017, We do not have the specific data that says what contributes to this success rate for example: summer vacations and /or higher number of tourists during the time of May June July.

2.Even though this dataset shows out of 64196 people, 58457 contributed to successful campaigns for theater category, we cannot say what number of people will actually contribute to the play “fever” based on these number this is out of our control.

4.We also do not know how this data is collected and whether we have missed any age group or demography, elements that can be helpful in determining the metrics of successful campaign.

5.location or area of the play and who actually spent money to go watch a play in theaters in those locations is a good contributor that will give us more precise information and understanding to plan our campaign.


**Other possible tables and/or graphs :**

1.Outcomes based on backers count, Chart and analysis are available in excel file attached below, In the category theaters and plays, 65.5% (42072/64196) of all people contributed to plays, out of which 60.8% (39032/64196) of people contributed to successful plays

2.Outcomes based on average duration of campaign for category theater, Chart and analysis in excel file attached, Out of the total number of successful plays 1066, the average duration of campaign is 29 days , Its safe to say Louise’s campaign should last 29 days minimum

**Analysis based on goals under 10k and over 10k:

1.	Total number of events for the category play with goals under $10000 is 900, When goals are below $10000 the successful outcome are 622, that is 70 % (622/889) success rate     and 29007 people contributed for these events with lower goals. How many people will contribute to Louises play is not something we can predict exactly however this is a         good insight to know more people are contributing to the plays with lesser goals 

2.	Total number of events for category plays with goals equal to $10000 or above are 158, successful plays are 72, 45.5% success rate, 12891 people contributed for these events.

3.	Overall fundraising events - 4114 , out of which total plays are 1066 that is 25.9% of all event are plays.

**Results:**

1.It’s safe to say that to successfully reach the goal of $10000 we need to launch the campaign in the month of may, second best options are June or July, Its best not to launch our campaign during the month of dec.

2.We recommend the campaign last at least 29 days before closing.

3.We have a better chance of being a successful if we lower our fund-raising goal of $10000, to fit into the range of $5000 to 9999 USD.
